Spectrum at Cal

Our mission is to foster understanding and create a welcoming and safe community for all those affected by Autism. We raise awareness throughout the Berkeley community, offer a variety of volunteer opportunities, and hold fundraising events. *formerly Autism Speaks U at Berkeley**
I would say this collaboration is amzaing.

I will do the coding part Ellie, you do the description. Is that okay?**

```python
def rec_fib(n):
    '''inefficient recursive function as defined, returns Fibonacci number'''
    if n > 1:
        return rec_fib(n-1) + rec_fib(n-2)
    return n

```
